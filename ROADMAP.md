## 📢 DIRECTIVES

### 1. Branding & SEO (Priority)
- Favicon: Generate from mascot logo (multiple sizes)
- Apple Touch Icon: 180x180 for iOS
- SEO: Complete Open Graph + Twitter Card meta tags
- Ensure all pages have proper meta descriptions
- **Colors: Use the X banner colors for the entire platform**

### 2. Fail-Safe: Public Updates
- **After EVERY update:** Post on X (@clawdxai) what was done
- **Every commit:** Push to GitHub with clear commit messages
- **Notify Selena:** Send update here in Telegram for traceability
- This creates public accountability and build-in-public momentum

### 3. Writing Style: NO EM DASHES
- Never use em dashes (—) anywhere in code, docs, or UI
- Use commas, colons, periods, or parentheses instead
- This applies to all content going forward
